# 👋 Hi, I'm Bharat Kumar

🎯 **Data Research Analyst | Research Intelligence | BI & Data Quality Automation**

I’m a data research and analytics professional with 7+ years of experience in academic and scientific publishing. My work focuses on data quality engineering, research analytics, and automation, supporting large-scale datasets used in global university and research rankings.

I specialize in building audit-ready dashboards, data validation pipelines, and internal automation tools that reduce manual effort and turn complex data into decision-ready insights. My projects reflect real-world problems I’ve solved across QA, reporting, and research intelligence workflows.

## 🚀 My Featured Projects

### 🧹 [DataCleaner 2025 – CSV & Text Utilities Platform (Streamlit)](https://github.com/bharat1271/csv-cleaner-app)
A production-style Python + Streamlit web application designed to automate repetitive data-cleaning and text-processing tasks commonly encountered in QA and affiliation profiling workflows.

**Key capabilities**:

- End-to-end flow: upload → clean → preview → download (with traceable logs)
- CSV operations: duplicate removal, whitespace trimming, case normalization, missing values, column splits, numeric conversion
- Text utilities: OrgID extraction & validation, duplicate detection, Name–ID pairing, regex-based affiliation & group ID extraction
- OCR module for extracting structured text from screenshots and scanned content
- Iterative evolution from CLI → GUI → Web for usability across non-technical users

Built to reduce manual QA effort, minimize copy-paste errors, and standardize data validation at scale.
